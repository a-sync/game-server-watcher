# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Ok3pxv.png" width="40" align="left"> Game Server Watcher
A simple discord/telegram bot that can be hosted on a free service to monitor your game servers and players in style. ðŸ˜Ž  

# About the Project
The main goals of this repo:
 1. create a (simple, but capable) service/bot to monitor game servers
    1. get gamedig & steam api server info (_eg.: server name, map, players, etc._)
    1. relay real time server information to various channels via APIs (_eg.: discord, telegram, slack etc._)
 1. should be able to host on a free service (_target atm. is cloudno.de (node.js 12.20.1)_)
 1. graciously add more features based on community feedback via [discord](https://discord.gg/4tsbftsGJz) and [github](https://github.com/a-sync/game-server-watcher/discussions/new?category=ideas-requests)

# Project Status
The code itself is stable and continuously tested/deployed from the cloud branch.  

The project is in a very early stage. More detailed customization options and additional features will be added as requested.  

### Possible features and configuration options to add in the future
 * optional player list
   * with configurable fields. eg.: time,name,ping,score
   * configurable field & order to sort by
   * max length for player names & nr of players
 * custom embed fields for discord
 * _configurable timezone for graph x-axis_
 * refresh on reaction
 * watched players (notify when a watched player enters/leaves the server)
 * detect when the server goes offline, notify when player number crosses a threshold
 * bot commands (reinit message, cleanup, start/stop, configure)
 * more integrations: slack, ms teams, twillio (email, sms)
 * ~~web ui to manage & configure the servers and bots~~
 * put custom information in the channel name or bot status (online status indicator, number of players, map)
 * github action workflows to deploy to other cloud providers (heroku, azure, gcp, aws etc.)

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.  

## Requirements
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/) _(version 12.20.0 or later)_  

## Getting the source
This project is [hosted on github](https://github.com/a-sync/game-server-watcher). You can clone this project directly using this command:

```
git clone git@github.com:a-sync/game-server-watcher.git
```

The latest source and build can also be downloaded as a [zip archive](https://github.com/a-sync/game-server-watcher/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

## Installation
Use npm or yarn to install/update all the dependencies:
```
npm i
```

If you don't want to build from source, you can skip the development dependencies:  
```
npm i --only=prod
```

## Usage
Build the artifacts from source (optional):
```
npm run build
```

Start the built artifacts:
```
npm start
```

Build, start and auto restart on source changes:
```
npm run dev
```

## Settings
The behaviour of the watcher service can be configured via environmental variables (env vars).  
`.env` ([dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)) file is also supported, to look at the avaialable values and defaults check the [default.env](./default.env) file.  

Refer to the wiki on how to get tokens for:
 * [steam](https://github.com/a-sync/game-server-watcher/wiki/Steam-Web-API-key)
 * [discord](https://github.com/a-sync/game-server-watcher/wiki/Discord-bot-token)
 * [telegram](https://github.com/a-sync/game-server-watcher/wiki/Telegram-bot-token)

## Managing the service
**GSW Control Panel** is a web based UI that let's you configure and control the Game Server Watcher instance.  
The web app is served at `http://localhost:8080` by default.  
_Make sure to configure a proper `SECRET` env var to enable access!_  

### Configuration
Updates the configuration file and restarts the service.

### Flush game servers data
Removes population history data. (configured by _Graph history time span_ server option)

### Flush discord data
If the original message created by the bot gets deleted, you might need to flush the bot data to reinitialize the message.  
_The bot has no cleanup functionality, left over messages must be removed manually._

### Flush telegram data
If the original message created by the bot gets deleted, you need to flush the bot data to reinitialize the message.  
_The bot has no cleanup functionality, left over messages must be removed manually._
